## What is Java?
Java is a cross-platform object-oriented programming language that was released by Sun Microsystems in the year 1995. Today, Java is needed to run various applications such as games, social media applications, audio and video applications, etc.

## What is Java used for?
Before I go ahead with this, let me brief you about why you should choose Java. It is highly popular and has dominated this field from early 2000’s till the present 2018. 

## It is used for:

* Banking: To deal with transaction management.
* Retail: Billing applications that you see in a store/restaurant are completely written in Java.
* Information Technology: Java is designed to solve implementation dependencies.
* Android: Applications are either written in Java or use Java API.
* Financial services: It is used in server-side applications.
* Stock market: To write algorithms as to which company they should invest in.  
* Big Data: Hadoop MapReduce framework is written using Java.
* Scientific and Research Community: To deal with huge amount of data.

## Why to learn Java programming?
* __Object Oriented__ − In Java everything is an Object. Java can be easily extended since it is based on Object model.
* __Platform Independent__ − Unlike many other programming languages including C and C++, when Java is compiled, it is not compiled into platform specific machine, rather into platform independent byte code. This byte code is distributed over the web and interpreted by the Virtual Machine (JVM) on whichever platform it is being run on.
* __Simple__ − Java is designed to be easy to learn. If you understand the basic concept of OOP Java, it would be easy to master.
* __Secure__ − With Java's secure feature it enables to develop virus-free, tamper-free systems. Authentication techniques are based on public-key encryption.
* __Architecture-neutral__ − Java compiler generates an architecture-neutral object file format, which makes the compiled code executable on many processors, with the presence of Java runtime system.
* __Portable__ − Being architecture-neutral and having no implementation dependent aspects of the specification makes Java portable. Compiler in Java is written in ANSI C with a clean portability boundary, which is a POSIX subset.
* __Robust__ − Java makes an effort to eliminate error prone situations by emphasizing mainly on compile time error checking and runtime checking.
