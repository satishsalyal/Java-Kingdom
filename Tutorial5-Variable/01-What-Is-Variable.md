># What is Variable?

A variable is a name given to a memory location. It is the basic unit of storage in a program.

* The value stored in a variable can be changed during program execution.
* A variable is only a name given to a memory location, all the operations done on the variable effects that memory location.
* In Java, all the variables must be declared before use.

## How to declare variables?

We can declare variables in java as follows:

![the_way](images/variables_java_second.png)

__type__ : Type of data that can be stored in this variable.

__name__: Name given to the variable.

* Variable Initialization
* Assigning value by taking input

__datatype__: Type of data that can be stored in this variable.

__variable name__: Name given to the variable.

__value__: It is the initial value stored in the variable.

##### Example

```java
float simpleInterest; //Declaring float variable

int time = 10, speed = 20; //Declaring and Initializing integer variable

char var = 'h'; // Declaring and Initializing character variable
```
## Types of Variables

There are three types of variables in Java:

* __Local Variables__    

* __Instance Variables__

* __Static Variables__

Let us now learn about each one of these variables in detail.

__Local Variables__: 

 A variable defined within a block or method or constructor is called local variable.

* These variable are created when the block in entered or the function is called and destroyed after exiting from the block or when the call returns from the function.

* The scope of these variables exists only within the block in which the variable is declared. i.e. we can access these variable only within that block.

* Initilisation of Local Variable is Mandatory.

##### [Example 01](../20-Examples/05-Variable/01-What-is-Variable/Example-01/)

```java
public class StudentDetails { 

	public void studentAge(){ 
		// local variable age 
		int age = 0; 
		age = age + 5; 
		System.out.println("Student age is : " + age); 
	} 

	public static void main(String args[]){ 
		StudentDetails obj = new StudentDetails(); 
		obj.studentAge(); 
	} 
} 
```

##### Output

	Student age is : 5

In the above program, the variable `age` is a local variable to the function `studentAge()`. 

If we use the variable age outside `studentAge()` function, the compiler will produce an error as shown in below program.



##### [Example 02](../20-Examples/05-Variable/01-What-is-Variable/Example-02/)

```java
public class StudentDetails {

    public void studentAge(){ 
		// local variable age 
        int age = 0; 
        age = age + 5; 
    } 
  
    public static void main(String args[]){ 
        // using local variable age outside it's scope 
        System.out.println("Student age is : " + age); 
    } 
} 
```

##### Output:

 __Compilation Error in java code__ 

	prog.java:103: error: cannot find symbol System.out.println("Student age is : " + age);
											
	symbol:   variable age
	location: class StudentDetails

	1 error

## Instance Variable


__Instance Variables__: Instance variables are non-static variables and are declared in a class outside any method, constructor or block.
* As instance variables are declared in a class, these variables are created when an object of the class is created and destroyed when the object is destroyed.

* Unlike local variables, we may use access specifiers for instance variables. If we do not specify any access specifier then the default access specifier will be used.

* Initilisation of Instance Variable is not Mandatory. Its default value is 0
Instance Variable can be accessed only by creating objects.

##### [Example 03](../20-Examples/05-Variable/01-What-is-Variable/Example-03/)

```java
class Marks { 
	// These variables are instance variables. 
	// These variables are in a class 
	// and are not inside any function 
	int engMarks; 
	int mathsMarks; 
	int phyMarks; 
}
```

```java
class MarksDemo { 

	public static void main(String args[]) 
	{ 
		// first object 
		Marks obj1 = new Marks(); 
		obj1.engMarks = 50; 
		obj1.mathsMarks = 80; 
		obj1.phyMarks = 90; 

		// second object 
		Marks obj2 = new Marks(); 
		obj2.engMarks = 80; 
		obj2.mathsMarks = 60; 
		obj2.phyMarks = 85; 

		// displaying marks for first object 
		System.out.println("Marks for first object:"); 
		System.out.println(obj1.engMarks); 
		System.out.println(obj1.mathsMarks); 
		System.out.println(obj1.phyMarks); 

		// displaying marks for second object 
		System.out.println("Marks for second object:"); 
		System.out.println(obj2.engMarks); 
		System.out.println(obj2.mathsMarks); 
		System.out.println(obj2.phyMarks); 
	} 
}
```

##### Output:
	Marks for first object:
	50
	80
	90
	Marks for second object:
	80
	60
	85

As you can see in the above program the variables, `engMarks` , `mathsMarks`, `phyMarksare` instance variables. In case we have multiple objects as in the above program, each object will have its own copies of instance variables. It is clear from the above output that each object will have its own copy of instance variable.

## Static Variable

__Static Variables__: Static variables are also known as Class variables.

* These variables are declared similarly as instance variables, the difference is that static variables are declared using the static keyword within a class outside any method constructor or block.

* Unlike instance variables, we can only have one copy of a static variable per class irrespective of how many objects we create.

* Static variables are created at the start of program execution and destroyed automatically when execution ends.
Initilisation of Static Variable is not Mandatory. Its default value is 0

* If we access the static variable like Instance variable (through an object), the compiler will show the warning message and it wonâ€™t halt the program. The compiler will replace the object name to class name automatically.

* If we access the static variable without the class name, Compiler will automatically append the class name.

To access static variables, we need not create an object of that class, we can simply access the variable as

```java
ClassName.variableName;
```

##### [Example 04](../20-Examples/05-Variable/01-What-is-Variable/Example-04/)

```java
class Emp { 
	// static variable salary 
	public static double salary; 
	public static String name = "Harsh"; 
} 
```

```java
public class EmpDemo {

	public static void main(String args[]){ 
		// accessing static variable without object 
		Emp.salary = 1000; 
		System.out.println(Emp.name + "'s average salary:" + Emp.salary); 
	} 
} 
```

##### Output:

	Harsh's average salary:1000.0
