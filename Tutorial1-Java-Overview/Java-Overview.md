># Java Overview


Java is a high level programming language originally developed by Sun Microsystems and released in 1995. Currently it is owned by Oracle and nearly 3 billion devices run on Java.

It is used for
* Mobile Application (Specially for Android devices)
* Desktop Applications
* Web Applications
* Web Servers and application servers
* Games
* Database connection

And more things.

## Why to learn Java programming?
* __Object Oriented__ − In Java everything is an Object. Java can be easily extended since it is based on Object model.
* __Platform Independent__ − Unlike many other programming languages including C and C++, when Java is compiled, it is not compiled into platform specific machine, rather into platform independent byte code. This byte code is distributed over the web and interpreted by the Virtual Machine (JVM) on whichever platform it is being run on.
* __Simple__ − Java is designed to be easy to learn. If you understand the basic concept of OOP Java, it would be easy to master.
* __Secure__ − With Java's secure feature it enables to develop virus-free, tamper-free systems. Authentication techniques are based on public-key encryption.
* __Architecture-neutral__ − Java compiler generates an architecture-neutral object file format, which makes the compiled code executable on many processors, with the presence of Java runtime system.
* __Portable__ − Being architecture-neutral and having no implementation dependent aspects of the specification makes Java portable. Compiler in Java is written in ANSI C with a clean portability boundary, which is a POSIX subset.
* __Robust__ − Java makes an effort to eliminate error prone situations by emphasizing mainly on compile time error checking and runtime checking.
